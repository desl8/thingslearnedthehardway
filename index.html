  <h1>Things learned the hard way</h1>
  <h2>A comprehensive list of my mental shortcomings</h2>
  <br>
  <p>1. Elementary schools like to move the speed bumps every day</p>
  <p>2. The washing machine is not a good wheel for your hamster</p>
  <p>3. When the police point a radar gun at your car, you should not shoot them back</p>
  <p>4. Pleading the second in court does not mean you can shoot the judge</p>
  <p>5. Fireworks made with live rounds are potentially hazardous for your party guests</p>
  <p>6. If you shoot the ghosts at the haunted house, the police get involved</p>
  <p>7. When people said to pour liquids on a fire to put it out, they apparently did not mean gasoline</p>
  <p>8. Pulling the metal off of the top of an avocado causes it to blow up</p>
  <p>9. Taking the engines off the plane midflight is not a good way to improve fuel economy</p>
  <p>10. TSA officers do not appreciate when you use their tazer on other travellers</p>
  <p>11. Fire pits are not a good way to dispose of UXO</p>
  <p>12. Turns out that if you sneeze on Grandma, she becomes a cloud</p>
  <p>13. If your baby is being baptised, do not forget to take them out of the water before you leave</p>
  <p>14. Shooting down a rescue helicopter is not a good way to alert them to your presence</p>
  <p>15. Eating brick of pure potassium is not a good substitute for bananas</p>
  <p>16. Pouring a water bottle in that funny box next to Grandpa's hospital bed makes him sleep for a very long time
  </p>
  <p>17. When the history teacher says to write an essay on drugs, he means write an essay about drugs</p>
  <p>18. When making desserts, do not confuse cocoa powder with coca powder</p>
  <p>19. When the TSA officer asks you to take off your shoes, they do not want you to take off the rest of your clothes</p>
  <p>20. Rolling a bowling ball down a crowded escalator is a great way to clear up traffic, and an even better way to get arrested</p>
  <p>21. When somebody says their dog needs its stomach pumped, they do not mean with a shotgun</p>
  <p>22. </p>
